00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,360
what early Rising means Anna yes I do early Rising means getting up early in

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,640
the morning usually Before Sunrise or before most people wake up that's right

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,960
and why do you think some people choose to be early risers

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,360
Anna well there are many possible reasons Emma some people may have to

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,920
wake up early for work or school or to take care of their family or pets some

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,520
people may want to wake up early to have more time for themselves to do some

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,320
exercise meditation reading or other Hobbies some people may believe that

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,159
waking up early can make them more productive creative or

13
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,680
happy I see and what about you Anna are you an early riser

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:21,640
yourself actually I am Emma I usually wake up around 5 a m every day wow

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,159
that's impressive how do you manage to do that Anna well Emma it's not easy I

16
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,079
admit it took me some time and effort to develop this habit of early Rising but I

17
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,680
think it's worth it because I enjoy the benefits of waking up early what are

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,320
some of the benefits that you enjoy Anna first of all I enjoy the peace and quiet

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,920
of the early morning there is less noise traffic and distraction I can focus on

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,960
myself and my goals I can plan my day ahead and set my

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,159
priorities I can also do some activities that I love such as yoga yoga journaling

22
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,960
or listening to podcasts that sounds wonderful Anna I

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,280
can see how waking up early can help you start your day on a positive note yes

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,239
exactly another benefit that I enjoy is that I feel more energetic and alert

25
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,000
throughout the day I don't feel sleepy or sluggish in the afternoon I can

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,120
accomplish more tasks and be more efficient I can also handle stress and

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,480
challenges better because I have a clear mind in a good mood I agree Anna I think

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,800
waking up early can boost your physical and mental health it can also improve

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,200
your quality of sleep because you are more likely to go to bed earlier and

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,720
have a regular sleep schedule that's true Emma a good night sleep is

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,519
essential for your well-being it can help you recover from fatigue enhance

32
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,280
your memory and strengthen your immune system wow Anna you have convinced me

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,760
that waking up early has many advantages but I have a question for you how do you

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,959
actually wake up early do you have any tips or tricks that you can share with

35
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,519
us of course Emma I'm happy to share some tips and tricks that work for me

36
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,440
but I want to remind you that everyone is different and what works for me may

37
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,560
not work for you you have to experiment and find out what suits you best that's

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,959
a good point Anna thank you for being honest and

39
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,640
realistic you're welcome Emma so the first tip that I have is to have a

40
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,200
strong motivation for waking up early you have to know why you want to do it

41
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,080
and what benefits you expect to gain from it you have to have a clear goal

42
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,400
and a vision that inspires you and drives you I see so for example if I

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,840
want to wake up early to learn English I have to remind myself of how much I love

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,720
English and how much I want to improve my skills and

45
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,959
confidence exactly Emma you have to keep your passion and

46
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,079
purpose in mind and use them as your fuel you can also write down your goal

47
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,319
and your reasons and put them somewhere you can see them every morning such as

48
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,560
your bedside table your wall or your phone that's a great idea Anna I think

49
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,840
that can help me stay focused and motivated the second tip that I have is

50
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,479
to prepare everything you need the night before you have to make it easy for

51
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,720
yourself to wake up early and eliminate any obstacles or excuses that may stop

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,880
you you have to plan your morning routine and set up your environment

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,600
accordingly what do you mean by that Anna I mean that you have to prepare

54
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,320
everything you need for your morning activities such as your clothes your

55
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,680
breakfast your books your laptop Etc you have to make sure that everything is

56
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,039
ready and accessible so that you don't waste time or energy looking for them or

57
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,560
making them in the morning I understand so for example if I want to wake up

58
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,919
early to do some yoga I have to lay out my yoga man my yoga clothes and my water

59
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,800
bottle the night before exactly Emma you have to make it

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,199
as convenient and simple as possible for yourself to follow your morning routine

61
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,720
you can also set up some cues or reminders that can help you get started

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,440
such as an alarm a note a picture or a playlist that makes sense Anna I think

63
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,759
that can help me overcome my inertia and LA

64
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,639
the third tip that I have is to adjust your bedtime gradually you have to make

65
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,919
sure that you get enough sleep otherwise you will feel tired and miserable in the

66
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,560
morning you have to go to bed earlier and avoid any distractions or stimulants

67
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,720
that can keep you awake such as your phone your TV your coffee or your

68
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,680
alcohol I agree Anna sleep is very important for your health and

69
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,479
performance but how can I go to bed earlier if I'm used to staying up plate

70
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,800
well Emma you can't change your habits overnight you have to do it step by step

71
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,599
and be consistent you can start by going to bed 15 minutes earlier than usual and

72
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:15,639
then gradually increase the time until you reach your desired

73
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,360
bedtime you can also use some tools or techniques that can help you fall asleep

74
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,599
faster such as meditation breathing exercises aroma therapy or relaxing

75
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:34,280
music I see so for example if I want to wake up at 6 a m and I need 8 hours of

76
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,080
sleep I have to go to bed by 10 p m but if I usually go to bed at midnight I

77
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:48,560
have to start by going to bed at 11:45 p n and then 1130 pm. and so on until I

78
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,199
reach 10 p.m. that's right Emma you have to be patient and persistent and not

79
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,560
give up you have to reward yourself for your progress and celebr celebrate your

80
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,720
achievements the fourth tip that I have is to have a buddy or a partner who can

81
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,360
support you and hold you accountable you have to find someone who shares your

82
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,759
goal of waking up early and who can motivate you and challenge you you have

83
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,479
to communicate with them regularly and check on each other's progress and

84
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,360
difficulties I like that idea Anna I think having a buddy or a partner can

85
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,440
make the journey more fun and rewarding but how can I find someone who is is

86
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,280
willing to wake up early with me well Emma you can start by asking your

87
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,840
friends family or colleagues if they're interested in joining you you can also

88
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,879
join some online communities or groups that are dedicated to early Rising such

89
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:52,199
as forums blogs podcasts or social media platforms you can also use some apps or

90
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,560
websites that can help you find and connect with other early risers such as

91
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,560
wake up early bird or rise wow Anna you have done your research I didn't know

92
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,960
there were so many resources and tools that can help me find a buddy or a

93
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,039
partner for waking up early yes Emma there are and I encourage you to explore

94
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,080
them and see what works for you you may be surprised by how many people are

95
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,000
willing to support you and join you in your quest thank you Anna I appreciate

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
your advice and your encouragement you're very welcome Emma the fifth and

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,599
Final tip that I have is to be flexible and adaptable you have to understand

98
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,279
that waking up early is not a one-size fits all solution and that it may not

99
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,440
work for everyone or every situation you have to listen to your body and your

100
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,200
needs and adjust your schedule accordingly what do you mean by that

101
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,560
Anna I mean that you have to be realistic and flexible about your goal

102
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,480
of waking up early you have to accept that there may be some days when you

103
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,480
can't or don't want to wake up early and that's okay you don't have to feel

104
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,760
guilty or disappointed you can just try again the

105
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,160
next day I see so for example if I have a late night out with my friends or if

106
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,399
I'm feeling sick or if it's a weekend I can allow myself to sleep in a little

107
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,640
bit exactly Emma you have to be kind and gentle with yourself and not force

108
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,720
yourself to do something that doesn't suit you or your

109
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,760
situation you have to find a balance between your goal and your lifestyle and

110
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,600
adapt to the changes and challenges that may arise that makes sense Anna I think

111
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,040
being flexible and adaptable can help me avoid frustration and burnout yes Emma
